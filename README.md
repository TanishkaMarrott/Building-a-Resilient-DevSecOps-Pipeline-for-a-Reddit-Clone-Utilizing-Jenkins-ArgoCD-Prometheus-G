# Deploying a Scalable Reddit Clone in a Secure Cloud-Native Ecosystem

## Quick Introduction:-

### Aim:-     
**Deploy a Reddit Clone Application** in the AWS environment, with a prime focus on the non-functional aspects.       
We've leveraged the flexibility of **Kubernetes for orchestration** + **Docker for containerization** + **a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment**. More on **Jenkins & ArgoCD** subsequently...

As always, my project seeks to ensure **scalability**, **resilience**, and seamless updates. That's actually because it provides a robust foundation for the application's growth and evolution.      

The deployment strategy is designed to **maximize uptime and efficiency**, while **security** measures are integrated at every step to protect against vulnerabilities and threats, 
--> making the application reliable and super-secure



## Setting The Context
Before actually diving deep into the project at hand, I'd like to quickly set the context as to how DevSecOps emerge.

--> DevOps, it's actually a set of practices, methodologies. It's absolute aim is improvising the quality and the pace at which applications and services are delivered, right from development to Operations.        
It strives to make Software Releases faster, increases Deployment pace, automates builds, tests to ensure everything's functional and stable. More on this subsequently...

Core principles that serve as a crux here:-

1- Automation, It's all about automating repetitive tasks, --> Core Principle here. It involves
