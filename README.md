Now that we're done with the CI part, we'd move to the deployment aspect

--

Key intent:- automating the deployment of code from dev to prod, post a successful build ▶️

</br>

> ➡️ Means a faster deployment velocity = Accelerated releases = Faster Time-to-market 

</br>

### _Is Testing a part of both CI and CD?_

         
True...

But the kind and the emphasis of testing differs

What does this mean?

➡️ Testing in CI is primarily about running tests against the code to ensure the codebase is stable and functional throughout.

</br>

> Integrating multiple code changes into the main-stream, shouldn't break production. --> **Unit testing** & **Integration testing**.   ☑️

</br>

> My goal here is frequent, incremental updates - (**Immediate feedback** = **Quicker Iterative loops**) 👍

</br>

--

When I talk about CD, it's not only about a "bug-free" code. You need some other types of testing too, **Security testing**, **Performance Testing**, **UAT testing**. Making my software production-ready, considering all non-functional aspects as well. 

</br>

> *Is my software production ready? Can this be delivered to my users? Does it meet the overall high quality standards?* CD answers such questions.

</br>

Let's start with the Terrform Configurations...

</br>

Please check my code here:- https://github.com/TanishkaMarrott/AWS-EKS-TF/tree/main'

</br>

---

## _TF Configurations - Non functional Aspects:-_

### _Multi-AZ NAT Gateway Setup + Multi-AZ Worker node deployments:-_ 

In this architecture, I've deployed **three NATs each with its own Elastic IP**, for **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.

</br>

> We need to  ensure that our architecture can withstand an AZ Failure. If one NAT gateway becomes unavailable due to some issue in an AZ, we can still route outbound traffic to the internet. Any AZ-failure does not impact the availability of our application, hence **fault-tolerant**.   

</br> 

▶ **High Availability** = **Fault Tolerance** = 👍

</br>

 Second, **Performance Optimization**.  

</br>   

>  I didn't want any SPOFs or performance bottlenecks in my architecture. Multi -NAT ensures that traffic from the instances do not necessarily need to cross inter-AZ for reaching the internet, = reducing **Latency** 👍. It does help in the scalability aspect as well since resources in each AZ can scale out independently. We can add new subnets, add new instances in each AZ, without worrying NAT Gateway being a potential bottleneck. 💡

</br>

➡ However, this is a **cost vs. fault tolerance trade-off**. This decision means prioritizing availability and performance over the cost considerations.

</br>

#### _Are we utilising both public and private subnets. Why?_

</br>

> My public subnets host the Load Balancers and NAT Gateways (the resources which are actually intended to be public), so, they'll distribute incoming internet traffic to the pods running the application. ➡️ This setup simplifies and centralizes traffic management while keeping our backend pods secure.

> Also, in case the applications in the private subnet wish to connect to the internet, for example for updates, APIs etc., it will be done via the NAT deployed in each public subnet

**secure outbound-only internet access** 👍.

</br>

### _Granular Access controls for EKS_

I've pruned down the **public access CIDR** allowed to access the Kubernetes API Server. Having centralized control over access and management.

</br>

> By doing so, we're adopting a **principle of least privilege** and reducing the surface area for potential cyber threats.

</br>

> I'd advise to **tighten up security** to the **Corporate IP Address Range** as an ingress rule for the node group, that's something we might need for troubleshooting or administrative access

</br>

I've made sure the **IAM Policies** attached to the cluster and the node group are tied down. Chances of privilege escalation will be low.

</br>

Plus, we have **endpoint access restrictions**, and **secured SSH Access** - to the worker nodes by specifying source security group IDs and SSH keys.

</br>

### _Terraform State Backend - S3 + DynamoDB --> Concurrency + State Locking_

</br>

> I wanted to eliminate potential chances of State Corruption that might happen during multiple Terraform applies. + DynamoDB will be used as a durable data-store for State Locking.

</br>

> topping it up, with **S3 Versioning** on our backend S3 bucket to keep a history of our state files,▶️ for recovery from unintended changes. + **S3 Encryption** 👍

</br>

### _How did I optimise on costs while still maintaining a level of fault-tolerance?_

Mix of both On-demand and Spot Instances

</br>

> We wanted to achieve a certain level of cost optimization as well while still retaining our fault tolerance capabilities. Hence, I've decided to go in for:-
**1- Two separate node groups: one for critical workloads (on-demand), and Spot for cost optimization.**
     
**Multiple Instance groups** have been specified to increase chances of Spot Instances fulfillment.

</br>

---> This means we have an **On-Demand capacity** to handle **Baseline Application Performance** + a **Spot Allocation strategy** as a **Cost Optimization strategy**. 👍 ☑️

</br>

## _Why ArgoCD?_

 It's actually a brilliant "declarative, GitOps CD Tool." 

_**It ensures that my actual state of the Kubernetes matches the configuration manifests in the Git repo**_, (That's the **desired state** of the cluster).

</br>

>   _Automated, Repeatable and most importantly Reliable Deployments_ 👍

</br>

So, that's something I like.... ArgoCD automatically checks for differences between your current state of K8s cluster and what's in the manifest files, means that my changes are **automatically deployed** and reflected in the live environment, as soon as they're pushed.

</br>

>  **Every change's versioned**, just in case changes don't go as planned, you can always **rollback to a previous state**

</br>

Here's the link to my K8s manifest files:- https://github.com/TanishkaMarrott/Reddit-Clone-K8s-Manifests

</br>

---

</br>

## _Quick Dive into the k8 manifests + Key Design Considerations_


#### 1- **`Deployment.yaml`** 

Blueprint for the Reddit-Clone pods we'll be creating

</br>

_How did I improvise the deployment to be available and fault tolerant?_

☑ I've increased the number of Pod Replicas, K8s would then ensure that we'll have 2 instances of our application running at any given time. -> Availability, Load Distribution                  

☑ I've also specified the CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the container. Requests would be guranteed by the kuberenetes scheduler, while limits would ensure that none of our pods is inadvertently consuming excessive resources ▶️ Efficient resource Utilisation and High Availability 🏁 👍

</br>

> I'd been observing that there was an uneven scheduling of pods across the nodes. Hence, I had to utilise the `topologySpreadConstraint` parameter, to ensure we're utilising our resources evenly. And a `maxSkew` parameter, this means resilient scheduling of pods across Nodes.


</br>

---

</br>

#### 2- **`Service.yaml`** 

We're exposing the set of pods running the containerised application through the Service of type loadBalancer. It listens for traffic on port 80 and forwards it to port 3000 - the port the application listens on within the container.

</br>

_The non-functional aspects I've included:-_

☑ I've made use of K8s annotations for Cross-Zone Load Balancing = High Availability - Distributes Traffic evenly across pods in multiple Availability Zones 
Network Load Balancer naturally does ensure scalability - ➡️ NLB means Super-low Latency + Super High Performance 👍

☑ Also, client source ips are preserved to ensure a better security, --> this will later help us in implementing WAF NACls that could be associated with the API Gateway fronting the LB --> Enhanced Security ☑️ 

</br>

---

</br>

#### 3- **`Ingress.yaml`**

I'm using this alongside the service object. In general, an Ingress would be used for its path-routing capabilities, -- you could actually host multiple applications on just a single IP, and route traffic to different backend service based on the path.

</br>

> ➡️ At times, when you're having multiple services, I'd not advise creating multiple services of type `LoadBalancer` , That wouldn't be a wise decision, Use an Ingress Controller to distribute / route the traffic based on the path in the URL. You'll simplify your network setup, while saving on extra infra costs.

</br>

In my case, I'd be utilising an ingress controller for its advanced traffic management + SSL termination capabilities. A standard way for exposing Services with a single external access point Provides scope, to maybe use some ACLs for IP Whitelisting, Geo-restrictions in conjunction with an AWS API Gateway/ WAF for an eve better security posture. 👍

☑️ I've limited the connections and requests per second, helps prevent resource exhaustion and overwhelming of backend services 🏁 ✔

</br>

---

</br>

#### 4 - **`Cluster-autoscaler.yaml`** & 5. **`HPA-manifest.yaml`** 

_Scaling via Cluster Auto-Scaler and Horizontal Pod Scaler_

</br>

> We wanted something that could adapt both at the pod and the node level. Something that can help us scale effectively in Kubernetes and manage workload fluctuations as well. Hence we added `cluster-autoscaler.yaml` and `hpa-manifest.yaml`

</br>

Hence, I've used both **Cluster Auto-scaler** and **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**,                
And how're they different? **Cluster auto-scaler** scales the nodes up and down in the event of a lack of sufficient resources to schedule pods or due to node utilization.              
**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** is about adjusting the number of pod replicas in a deployment, based on current demand, (We're considering **CPU Utilization** as our target metric here). This helps maintain an optimal application performance level as the workload changes.


</br>

---

</br>


#### 6. **`rbac-config.yaml`**

I've also included a template for `rbac-config.yaml`. Why? That's Kubernetes native way of Role Based Access Control. Finetuning Access Control to Kubernetes resources, either through User Accounts or Service Accounts

> Usually, pods make use of a Default Service Account, for performing all Kuberenetes API Operation. But, that's way too broad. If we're looking for a much more auditable, and secure K8s environment wherein permissions are scoped, we must create a specific SA, bind necessary permissions to the role -- (the one's I need for the application's proper functioning). This Role would then be attached to the SA... 

There's one more advantage to it. I'm not only adhering to the principle of Least privilege, We can also _scope_ permissions to a specific namespace, if we're looking for granular access control. User Accounts too can be granted specific permissions for the resources they need to access (pods etc.)

> Even in case of a compromise, chances of Privilege Escalation are minimized greatly

In our case, I've created a specific SA -> `app-service-account` and attached the `app-role` to it, comprising the `get` , `watch` , and `list` permissions inherited the pods running the application.

</br>

---

</br>

#### 7. **K8s Network Policies** - A side note

I haven't created a manifest specifically for network-policies, my current use-case doesn't require a policy restricting communication between pods running multiple applications.

</br>

> Basically, we make use of Network Policies in K8s for controlling the ingress, and egress at a pod level. You can have a `deny-all` policy`, restricting any ingress to all the pods (as specified by the selector) within a namespace. Or maybe have a specific Network Policy allowing inbound traffic from pods of a certain application within the same namespace. = Controlling Ingress/Egress , but at the pod level!

</br>

## Helm, Prometheus & Grafana - Monitoring + Visualisation

Helm - It's a package manager for kubernetes, Streamlines the process of deploying applications on K8s clusters. 🟩

> 🤔 I'd give a quick acronym here, Heard about Docker? What does it actually do? It packages the application code, libraries, necessary dependencies, and runtime environments into a single package (that's called an artifact). In the same way, Helm would package all K8s resources, like deployments, services. This means it more like a directory structure, packaging all K8s manifests, templates and config values.

</br>

**Key pointers about Helm:-**

Helm lets you manage complex K8s applications, It lets you template charts as well, That mean's it'll enable us to inject values and configurations at runtime. == Reproducibility and Reusability of K8 manifests

</br>

> 💡 Helm shares some similarity from a conceptual standpoint with GitOps Practices. Each time I install a new chart, it creates a new "release". So, this is a versioned snapshot, Helm keeps track of changes to your deployments. Just in case, the release isn't as well as it had been planned, you can rollback to a previous stable version. GitOps could extend this to a more broader sense, with both infrastructure provisioning / configuration plus the application deployment aspect...

</br>

We've added the Helm Repo `Prometheus-kube-stack.` This repo is a collection of all the k8s resources pertaining to Prometheus and Grafana. It lets you setup these tools in your cluster in a way that's fully integrated and easy to manage.  

</br>

## Prometheus and Grafana

--> Our monitoring and observability tool suite.

</br>

> Prometheus, it's actually a time- series database.... It's like a multi-dimensional model, with metric and some key-value pairs. It collects data from a wide array of sources, be it, infra-components, applications or  services..... That's through Exporters. Exporters expose metrics in a way that can be easily consumed by Prom. You can then make use of PromQl, to query the data, or have an Alerting manager setup / integrated with it, to trigger off notifications for anomalies.


</br>

A quick flow diagram to help you ingest this idea better:-

            Application/Service/
           Infrastructure Component
                   |
                   v
                 Exporter
            (Exposes Metrics)
                   |
                   v
               Prometheus
           (Time-Series Database)
                   |
                   v
         Querying with  PromQL /
      Alerting with Alert Manager


The prometheus stack, we installed using Helm, comes with the Grafana Deployment embedded.


So, what's Grafana? ⏬

Grafana is more of a Data Visualisation tool, you can actually fetch data from any of your Data sources, Prometheus in our case, and create dashboards, create graphs, heatmaps. You can have interactive dashboard with dynamic filtering cpabailities

</br>

> I've seen folks utilising it's ingrained alerting mechanism, it gels well with notification and reporting tools like email, slack, etc.


</br>

#### 🥇🏁 _Prometheus + Grafana = A powerful combo for monitoring and observability into application health & performance_ 

</br>

We've exposed these via a LoadBalancer Endpoint, not NodePort or ClusterIP

</br>

> Why? To make Prometheus and Grafana accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster, you should opt for NodePort or LoadBalancer services. NodePort can be suitable for smaller setups or environments where specific port access is manageable. Also, I wouldn't recommend it from a Security perspective. However, LoadBalancer offers a more scalable and user-friendly way to expose services, --> It distributes traffic and ensures service reliability and availability. ClusterIP is more suited for internal communications within the cluster and does not facilitate external access directly.

We've imported three dashboards here:-
&rarr; 💠 Pod Monitoring dashboard            
&rarr; 💠 Cluster Node Monitoring dashboard               
&rarr; 💠 Complete Monitoring dashboard               

</br>

### What do these dashboards represent? ⚛️

1-> _**The Pod monitoring dashboard**_ provides us with metrics + data specifically for individual pods, Meaning Pod Status, the CPU Memory Usage , the ntwrok usage, the volume of logs produced, the number of restarts etc, _So these are indicative of underlying issues with the pods_

2-> _**The Cluster Monitoring dashboard**_ indicate the overall health of a cluster with all its components, whether they're nodes, deployments, services etc. It more like a comprehensive dahsboard, covering the workload distribution, the number of deployments, nodes etc, Resource Utilisation, the health and status of nodes + alerting and monitoring notifications etc

3-> _**The Node Monitoring dashboard**_ is around pod allocation to the nodes, checks for Memory pressure, out of Disk or any such conditions for the nodes, the node utilisation metrics (over-utilised and underutilised), the health and status of the nodes, etc

## _The Logging Suite - EFK Stack_

- Since we're done with the monitoring and alerting aspect, let's turn to collecting, aggregating and analysing &  visualising our logs

You can check out my EFK manifests here:- https://github.com/TanishkaMarrott/EFK-Stack ☑️ 


### _Quick dive into what's EFK, and into its workflow_

EFK is a popular option for Log Collection, Aggregation and Visualisation.

#### _ElasticSearch_

> ElasticSearch is a very typical option when we're talking about a search and analytics engine , Not only does it store data collected from various data sources, it also has indexing, querying and searching capabilities, over a huge volume of loga data. Filtering and aggregating the logs as well

#### _FluentD_

It's our _**Data Collector and Shipper,**_
open source data collector + aggregator, for unified logging layers, it fetches, collects data from various sources, and them transforms into a unified format, forwards to elasticsearch.

#### _Kibana_

Role:- Data Visualisation and UI

**_Expore + Analyse + Visualise Log Data = Making sense of the collected log data in real-time_** 🙂

</br>

## _The EFK Workflow_

                 
                   Data Sources - (They could be log files, shippers, etc)                           
                              |                           
                              v                           
                   Fluentd (Data Aggregation and Transformation - Enriching it with metadata, transforming the data into a format suitable for ElasticSerach)               
                             |                           
                             v                           
                   Elasticsearch (Storage/Index - Storing, indicing the data, --> Search and alaytics engine)                     
                             |                           
                             v                           
                   Kibana (Visualization - gaining insights into patterns & trends)                  

                  

</br>

 Now let's discuss about our EFK Manifests, Apply the K8s manifests to create the EFK Deployment

</br>

>  💡 I'd like to clarify a few points here. Why did we create an EFK Stack, when we had Prometheus and Grafana deployed already? 🤔 Prometheus and Grafana help you with the "what" factor, the 'metrics'. that is what is happening in your system, what is the state of the health of your application at this point of time. EFK is more of a logging suite, It is used for collecting, aggregating and analysing log data, they provide context and detail into why something happened in your system, More like a narrative, providing insights into your system's behaviour

</br>

Both are complementary --> a powerful combination of comprehensive logging and monitoring suite 🏁 ✔️

Through Metrics, you'll get to know about "what" the problem is, in the system. Details and Context around the "root-cause" of the problem can be known through detailed logs, -- Specific error message, status codes etc

</br>

> --> a holistic observability = enhanced troubleshooting, and a better incident response post occurence of an event 👍 👍

</br>

---

### _More on the EFK Manifests:-_

#### 1 - **`namespace.yaml`** :- Applying this manifest would create a namespace `efklog` for the EFK stack components. 

</br>

> I haven't spoken much on namespaces. I'd like to give a quick brief with regards to this. Namespaces are an amazing way to enforce resource isolation, divide the cluster in a logical separation, meaning we can have multiple environments segregated within a cluster. And that's awesome. I can have multiple users across multiple teams working on a single cluster, and I can make use of RBAC - that's namespace scoped, That means users can access resources they're intended to.

</br>

#### 2 - **`ElasticSearch_Service.yaml`** :- We've configred the service to listen fro requests at port 9200, TCP Protocol, And forward these requests to `db` named port on the target pods selected by th `k8s-app: elasticsearch-logging` label. This creates a Service Object to expose the set of pods running the ElasticSearch application.

**_Purpose?_** It actually facilitates access to the underlying pods for sending the logs (as determined by the network policy), --> Centralised Log Aggregation to the ElasticSearch application 

</br>


#### 3 - **`ElasticSearch_StatefulSet.yaml`** :- 

This is where we make ElasticSearch secure, scalable and resilent. I've deployed multiple components here.

---

### _Security + Performance + Data Durability - How?_

> I'll quickly recapitulate the pointers/ non-functional enhancements we've done. First, a service account that'll be assumed, we'll bind a ClusteRole comprising the `get` permissions. So, I'm being very specific in the permissions attached to the SA , to be assumed for the ElasticSearch operations within the cluster -- with permissions to `get` resources like `endpoints` , `services` and `namespaces`. Chances of things being escalated are minimal, in case of compromise. As we've limited the operations ElasticSearch service can perform.

</br>

> Next, I wanted things to scale while still being cognizant of the maintained state, that's crucial here -- (Remember, ElasticSearch is a distributed database). So, we've increased the number of replicas. I had to optimise performance as well, so had to define resource requests and limits. This enabled me to ensure we've got sufficient resources for ElasticSearch, while not overwhelming / overconsuming system resources.

> Simultaneusly, I had to focus on Data Persistence to improve durability, I had to ensure that data is persistently stored across pod restarts and deployments. hence, we utilised `PersistentVolumeClaim` Plus, a rolling update strategy for minimal downtime

--

### _The Lacuna in this StatefulSet_

Okay, so this means there's a lacuna in this StatefulSet configuration❗

</br>

Not going too deep, but this is important. The `vm_max_map_count` is a system-level parameter in linux that defines the maximum number of memory-map areas a process may have. And it's crucial for such databases like ElasticSearch. We need to set a higher `vm.max_map_count` value (at least 262144) than the usual default.

In a k8s environment, adjusting system-level settings for the nodes, that too from within the pods isn't possible. 🤔 However, for the application to function optimally, I need to have this modified.

--

▶️ So, we've used an `initContainer` . `InitContainer`  runs to completion before other subsequent ElasticSearch Containers (In this eay, they'll have an environment set up and running.)
It must run in Privileged Mode, --> a container running in privileged mode, makes it nearly equivalent to being a root on the node machine

But containers running in priv mode is not recommended. High risk of Privilege Escalation in case of a VM Compromise.

--

➡ What could be the Security Risks? Well, if the container would be compromised by an attacker, he could gain root access to the node, gaining control over other containers and services running on the node. He could access any critical files & configuration settings; could deploy malware, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Endless possibilities, all boiling down to privilege escalation

</br>

### _How did we enhance security while solving this pain-point?_

By using DaemonSet. 💡

I'll explain how.

Consider I'm using the `initContainer` Approach. What does it do? Each time a pod restarts or is redeployed, the initContainer checks if this system-level Configuration `vm-max-map-count` , is 262144 in our case. Once this node-level configuration has been verified or applied if , subsequent ElasticSearch containers would run. 

> This means 1) Multiple `initContainers` in multiple pods = Multiple Containers running in privileged mode = High Risk in terms of security exposure

> 2) Besides a higher attack surface area, it also means a lag in pod startup times, = Operationally inefficient + a performance bottleneck

> This means I'm propagating changes from 'pod-level'. Not an ideal approach.

--

Now, let's shift to approach 2

I'm using a DaemonSet for this purpose. DaemonSet is a K8s object which is responsible for creating a copy of a specific pod across some / all nodes, as the case maybe.

How would it work? The DaemonSet would create a pod in each node, As new nodes are added to the cluster, it'll automatically deploy this pod to the new nodes as well.

There'll be a container within this pod, that'll be responsible for modifying the host kernel parameter - It's the `vm-max-map` count in our scenario. 
So, it's a one-time execution, this container executes once during the startup time, and this change is made once and persists beyond the lifecycle of the pod

> _So, how does it actually help us?_

Advantage 1 &rarr; There's a **consistent application of required system-level settings** across all nodes in a cluster

Advantage 2 &rarr; **Automatic application to new nodes in future**

Advantage 3 &rarr; We're **reducing the overhead that'll be incurred by the application pods,** due to checking or applying system-level settings, as these settings are pre-applied at the node level, reducing startup times and complexity.

 👍🙂

#### 4 - **`Fluentd_Config_Map.yaml`** :-

We'll be defining something called a ConfigMap. So, what's a configmap? It's used to store non-confidential data, in a key-value format. In our case, we'll be using a configMap to configure FluentD, our log collector and shipper

Let's make a deep-dive into this ⤵️

Cluster Logs --> Fluentd - Collection & Enrichment -->  Forwarded to ElasticSearch for Storage

1 - First things first, &rarr; system configurations. We'll specify the root directory for our fluentD buffers. Logging level set to info, configured the security settings like shared keys, including hostname verification

2- Next is the input configuration -- configuration for inputting the container logs.

What does this comprise?

We'll configure fluentd to "tail" container logs, With a position file to keep track of the logs that've already been read. 

3- Next up, some Data Enrichment as well. 📇

>  It not only parses JSON logs, but also enriches the logs by adding some context to it - k8s-specific info.  Implementing some sort of filters to transform the log records, and remove sensitive data (like passwords and secret keys). 👍

4 -

### _Specifics into Buffer configuration and overflow management_

</br>

> We had to ensure there's no data loss during high-volume periods, or in cases when the downstream system (ES in this case) is temporarily unavailable

</br>

What did we do? 

- **Mixing both memory and file based buffers :-** :bu

  Memory based buffers are suitable for faster data access. It's almost instantaneous. Which is brilliant for faster data ingestion and subsequent processing.
  
</br>

== This ends up reducing ovreall latency in the data ingestion and processing cycle. 💡

We couldn't ignore the data persistence capability as well. File based buffers store data on the disk, ---> Data can persist irrespective of system crashes, or when restarted. Also during spikes, or periods when there're high log volume, or when the downstream service is temporairly unreachable, File-based buffers are used to sustain such backpressure scenarios. It provides us with larger capacity when compared to memory buffers.
</br>

> 👍This means you don't only speed up the data ingestion process but still ensure that we've handled logs reliably in case of any system outages ☑ 

</br>


- Having some **limits on the total buffer size, and the max chunk size** ⤵️

One ➡️ there's an upper bound of 512 MB, of the total memory size of the buffer, prevents fluentd from consuming excessive memory resources

Two ➡️ we've also set a limit on the total chunk size, 16 MB for memory, and 2M for file based buffers. Smaller chunks makes them more manageable and can reduce latency, But we need to cognizant of the overhead that may come along. 16 MB is a good figure though.

</br>

- A **flush interval of 5 seconds** -->  not too short, not too frequent, helps reduce latency in forwarding/flushing the logs

- Our configuration also employs an **exponential retry strategy**, this means that if the logs cannot be directed downstream, for any problem whatsoever, FluentD would retry at increased intervals ☑️        

- Additionally, we've configured **overflow_action of block**, meaning if the buffer reaches its capacity, Fluentd will block new data from being buffered until space becomes available. 

</br>

> ➡️ This ensures that in event of buffer overflows, the action would be to block further buffering and prevent unbounded memory usage. 

</br>

I had to make some provisions for the max queue length limit and max time interval between the two subsequent retries for the file buffers

The logs are now "processed"

5 - We'll now direct these processed logs to the ElasticSearch instance port 9200, protocol https. It configures auth with ES, Also setups up buffering for outoutting the logs (file-based buffering here), I've also customised the naming pattern of ElasticSearch indexing, The indexing would be based on the orginating namespace and the current date.

### _How did we accelerate query and retrieval times in ES?_

</br>

> Why did we customise ES Indexing Names?  Being populated dynamically with the name of the originating namespace and its respective date, means a quicker query performance. Time-based Segmentation helps in implementing certain Stoarge Lifecycle Configuration. namespace Segragation also helps in an organised storage of logs and subsequently a faster retrieval. So, in future, if we'd wish to carry out historical data analysis, we'll be able to clearly delineate logs from different time periods and carry out Trend Analysis / Anomaly Detection

</br>

### _Security Enhancements we've primarily focused upon_:-

1- All communications between FluentD and other components, like K8s API and ElasticSearch are secured by TLS/SSL            
2- Interactions between FluentD instances for centralising the collected logs to a fluentD aggregator, are preceded by a mutual authentication via the `shared_key` . --> verifying the integrity and authenticity of the connection         
3- Hostname Verifications prevents traffic from being intercepted, prevents MITM - Man in the Middle Attacks            
4- Sensitive data has been filtered out before loga aggregation, this ensures none of the sensitive info/secrets lie exposed in the cluster logs.           
5 - Though I've covered buffer configuration management separately, it does partially fall in this context as well. There've been multiple measures implemented to ensure that resource usage is bounded, and thus preventing a DDoS Attack.         


---

#### 5. **`Fluentd_DaemonSet.yaml`** :-

Tasks we performed here:- 

1- Created an SA that will be assumed by the FluentD application pods to communicate with the K8s API Server            
2- A Cluster Role consisting fo the permissions that'll be needed by FluentD for collecting cluster-wide logs         
3- A role binding that'll be binding this ClusterRole to the SA . This means these pods will be able to inherit these permissions.         

4 - DaemonSet for FluentD

Why?

FluentD is a log forwarder. It doesn't need to be stateful. Moreover, we need to ensure that a fluentD pod runs across all the nodes of the cluster. Daemonset is necessary for ensuring that a copy of a specific pod, runs across all the nodes of a cluster including the ones that'll be added in future. 

> Running FluentD as a DaemonSet means I'm comprehensively covering node all across the cluster, uniform cluster-wide log collection + forwarding 👍

</br>

🏁 Quickly recapitulating why a daemonSet was used for Fluentd:-

1- As I discussed previously with you, FluentD is deployed as a DaemonSet because of its _guarantees_ the fact that the pod will be deployed on each and every node of the K8s cluster, ensuring we've got a reliable and robust, centralized logging solution, for the cluster all across...

2- Had it been a StatefulSet we would have been restrained to use stable network ids or maybe a persistent storage, which is out of context, for the use-case at hand.                      
FluentD needs to collect logs from node-specific paths like `/var/log`. DS will ensure it has got access to such paths on all nodes 

#### `Kibana_Deployment.yaml`

Kibana will be our visualisation component in our stack. Will be used for searchung, viewing and interacting with the data 📊

Okay, so let's focus on what are the non-functional aspects we've tried to incorporate in this deployment

💠-  Multiple replicas of Kibana pods, ▶ Higher availability. Even if one goes down, we've got another to serve requests, minimized downtime 👍

💠- These containers will be running as a non-root user (`runAsUser: 1000`). We have made it a point to explicitly set `runAsNonRoot: true` 
 ➡️ Strong SecurityContext reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. 

💠- Seccomp profile ...

</br>

> What's a seccomp profile? 🤔 This was new to me as well when I just started out... It's a feature, a kernel feature. that enables administrators to limit the system calls a container/ process can make. This has wide application in protecting against kernel-level exploits. It helps in reducing the attack-surface area by filtering the system calls it can make

</br>

💠- Having specified CPU and memory requests and limits, helps me in a dual manner. One, we've got sufficient resources for Kibana Containers for maintaining a stable operation, while still preventing them from over-consuming resources, affecting my other services ▶️ Efficient Resource Management

 💠- Liveness + Readiness Probes.                        
 Readiness = When a Kibana pod is ready to start accepting traffic, Liveliness = Checks if the pod requires a restart

💠- Plus a PVC - Persistent volume claim to preserve the application's state and configuration across restarts.
 
---

#### `Kibana_Service.yaml`

What're we essentially doing? Setting up a way to access the Kibana dashboard from outside the Kubernetes cluster... ☑️                

The LoadBalancer type automatically provisions an external load balancer (supported by the cloud provider) & assigns it a public IP that routes to Kibana (port 5601)

> ➡️ This means users can interact with Kibana’s UI by visiting `http://<External-IP>:5601`, where `<External-IP>` is the IP address allocated by the CP's load balancer.

## Wrapping it up!


A big thank you for accompanying me on this journey. It was an absolutely amazing experience!! 😊

--

This project,  was more around the paradigm shift... towards a much secure, scalable and I'd say, a _transparent_ software development process in the cloud

</br>

> And yes, there's definitely a scope of potential improvement here, improving the efficiency of existing components, or integrating newer / more optimised components to enhance it even further.

</br>

However in my humble opinion, by integrating tools like Jenkins, ArgoCD, SAST Tools, OWASPand our logging/monitroing suite -- Prometheus, Grafana and the EFK stack within the k8s eco, we have essentially built something, that holds a good potential to streamline development and deployment processes

▶ In way that's very well aligned with, I'd say, with the fast-paced business requirements

</br>

--> From an agility and security standpoint, if you actually wish to "create value", it is absolutely important to ingrain DevSecOps principles from the very beginning 💡

</br>

And hence, I've done my best in improvising this architectural workflow from a non-functional standpoint ➡️ security, scalability, cost-optimization and fault tolerance &rarr; all have been taken into account while creating this workflow 👍

> It's my passion to set a robust foundation that not only meets the current business needs but also anticipates future challenges.

Post continuous integration and deployment, the frameworks we've used for logging and monitoring are "lenses"          
Lenses for us to observe and understand our application's behaviour and performance - real-time.

I've just scratched the surface, there's a long way to go,  while crafting even better, resilent cloud solutions! 😊
